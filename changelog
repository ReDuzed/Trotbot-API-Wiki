# version 1.3.62.31 -> 1.3.64.32
## Changed
-> If program disconnects and cannot reconnect due to instanced variables, the 
	program will shut down, and granted there is a reconnect script, will
	then restart.
## Added
-> Two startup arguments, --skip-update for skipping the update-check step, and 
	--automated for skipping the manual plugin load step. With these two, 
	unattended running is possible in the case of an unexpected crash.
