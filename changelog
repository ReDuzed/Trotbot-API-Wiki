# version 1.3.56.28 -> 1.3.60.30
## Changed
-> "Up to date" message only shows conditionally after entering "y"
## Fixed
-> Reader output null or empty data mitigation
-> Reload command properly reinitializes plugins
## Removed
-> Unecessary database code
## Notes
-> There is a random connection error upon startup that is difficult to 
	troubleshoot but it might be fixed in this update (as in after the 
	changes it has not happened again)
